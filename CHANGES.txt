	:Introduce ITestFactory, deprecate @Factory 
	:Introduce Annotation Transformers

===========================================================================
5.1

Fixed: TESTNG-101 (HTML output contains nested <P> tags and a missing <tr> tag)
Added: support for specifying test-only classpath (http://forums.opensymphony.com/thread.jspa?messageID=78048&tstart=0)
Fixed: TESTNG-93 (method selectors filtering @BeforeMethod)
Fixed: TESTNG-81 (Assert.assertFalse() displays wrong expected, actual value)
Fixed: TESTNG-59 (multiple method selectors usage results in no tests run)
Fixed: TESTNG-56 (invocation of @Before/AfterClass methods in parallel/sequential scenarios)
Fixed: TESTNG-40 (failures suite does not contain @Before/After Suite/Test methods)
Fixed: TESTNG-37 (allow passing null parameter value from testng.xml)
Fixed: TESTNG-7 (display classname when hovering method)


Eclipse plug-in

Added: run contextual test classes with parameters from suite definition files
Added: TESTNG-100 (Show HTML reports after running tests)
Added: TESTNG-97 (Double click top stack to raise comparison)
Added: TESTNG-84 (plug-in UI for suite option should support absolute path)
Added: TESTNG-20 (copy stack trace)
